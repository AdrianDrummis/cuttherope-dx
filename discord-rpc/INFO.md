# How to give your mod custom Rich Presence

1. Create your own application on [discord.com/developers/applications](discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Name it as your mod and change the main picture (this will be the big app icon)
3. Copy it's Application ID and set DISCORD\_APP\_ID in RPCHelpers.cs as it
4. Go to Rich Presence -> Art Assets and upload your pack images in Rich Presence Assets. Make sure the key (name) for each image is pack\_\[number] (starting at 1).
5. Upload your mod's icon with the key "icon"
6. All done! Make sure all images are at least 512x512.

We provide the original images we use in case someone wants to use them.
